# Synchronizing a printing queue using a semaphore #

## About
This project is about a simple example of a printing queue shared by concurrent threads, which are synchronized by using a semaphore. The implementation uses an instance of the [`Sempahore`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html) class available at the [`java.util.concurrent` package](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html) provided by the Java programming language.

By implementing mutual exclusion supported by a semaphore, only one printing job (running as a thread) access the printing queue at a time. The semaphore blocks other jobs attempting to access the printing queue. After using the printing queue, the resource is released, and some job eventually suspended is notified for execution.
