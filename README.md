Example of a printing queue accessed by concurrent threads, which are synchronized by using a semaphore

# Synchronizing a printing queue #

## About
This project is about a simple example of printing queue accessed by concurrent threads, which are synchronized by using a [semaphore object](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html).

## Repository structure
Each package in repository contains source code demonstrating a different method for Java thread programming. 
Packages within [src/thread](src/thread) are organized as follows:

```
+─java-threads-examples       ---> Project directory
  ├─── doc                    ---> Directory with HTML pages resulted from generated Javadoc
  └─── src                    ---> Directory with source code files
       └─── thread
            └─── join         ---> Demonstration of the 'join' method
            └─── priority     ---> Demonstration of the assigment of priorities to threads
            └─── runnable     ---> Demonstration of the creation of threads using the Runnable interface
            └─── sleep        ---> Demonstration of the 'sleep' method
            └─── start        ---> Demonstration of the creation of threads by extending the Thread class
            └─── volatile     ---> Demonstration of the use of volatile variables with threads
```
